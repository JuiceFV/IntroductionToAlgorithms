# Exercise 2.1 - 2
### Task
>Rewrite the INSERTION-SORTprocedure to sort into nonincreasing instead of non-decreasing order.
### Libs
- iostream
### Plan
1. Set the key element that we will move. For the first step it will be 2nd element.
2. As long as the previous elements are less than the key element or we do not go beyond the array, we will replace each element with a key element.
3. Repeat for each element in an array.
